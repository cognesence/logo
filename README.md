## Overview

Welcome to the official repository for the Cognesence logo!

## Directory Structure

- `./logo.*` and `./logo_compact.*` - The logo is provided in two versions, a compact version (`logo_compact.*`) and a regular version (`logo.*`). Each of these comes pre-rendered at high resolution (`*.png`) or as a scalable vector graphics file (`*.svg`).
- `./preview/` - Previews of the different versions of the logo, with transparency rendered as a checkerboard pattern.

## Editing

For adjustments or custom sizes, we recommend using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), a powerful, open-source vector graphics editor that works seamlessly with SVG files.

## Usage Guidelines

While the Cognesence logo is open-source, it's important to use it appropriately. It may not be employed to misrepresent the Cognesence or in any way that suggests endorsement by Cognesence without explicit permission.

## License

This logo is provided under an open-source license. Feel free to use it in accordance with the terms set forth, keeping in mind the importance of proper representation of Cognesence.
